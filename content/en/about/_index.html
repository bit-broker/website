  <h2 id="contact">Contacting Us</h2>
  <p>We would really love to hear your thoughts about this website, about BitBroker or just about anything else.</p>
  <p>If you have issues or questions, we would encourage you first to have a good root around the <a href="/docs">public documentation</a>. Here you should find the answer to the most frequent questions. We will improve this documentation whenever new questions arise.</p>
  <p>If you don't find an answer to your question or issue, then please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/bit-broker/bit-broker/issues">open a new issue</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/bit-broker">main organization wide repo</a>. We endeavor to respond to all new issues in a prompt and timely manner. We might move your issue to one of the sub-repos, if it more appropriately belongs there.</p>
  <p>If you have a specific issue with one component which makes up BitBroker, then you should open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/bit-broker/repositories">that repository</a> directly. But, please do search through the existing open issue first in order to minimize duplication and potentially save yourself time. If you find an open issue already, do add a note to it explaining your perspective and experiences.</p>
  <p>If all else fails, then feel free to <a href="mailto:team@bit-broker.io">drop us an email</a>. Please include as much detail about your question or issue to help us resolve it as quickly as possible</p>
