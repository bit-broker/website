description: Foundational principles which cut-across all the BitBroker API sets
---

All the APIs within BitBroker conform to a common set of core principles. These are consistently applied across each API set:

* [Coordinator API](/docs/coordinator/)
* [Contributor API](/docs/contributor/)
* [Consumer API](/docs/consumer/)

In the section, we outline these foundational principles in detail.
