description: The API for managing the contribution of data to a BitBroker instance
---

The Contributor API is the API which is used for submitting data contributions into the  BitBroker [catalog](/docs/concepts/catalog/). It is tightly connected with the concepts of [entity types](/docs/concepts/entity-types/) and their associated [data connectors](/docs/concepts/connectors/).

It is important that you understand these, and other [key concepts](/docs/concepts/), before you begin using the Contributor API.

Before you use this API, you should become familiar with the general, system-wide [API conventions](/docs/api-conventions/) - which are used across all three BitBroker API sets. This covers topics such as API architecture, authorisation, error reporting and handling, etc.
