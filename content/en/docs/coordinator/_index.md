The Coordinator API is the main administrative API for the BitBroker system. It is the API you will need to use to create and manipulate all the [main system elements](/docs/concepts/) required to operate a BitBroker instance.

Before you use this API, you should become familiar with the general, system-wide [API principles](/docs/api-principles/) - which are used across all three BitBroker API sets. This covers topics such as API structures, error reporting and handling, authorisation, server names and ports, etc.
