The Coordinator API is the main administrative API for the BitBroker system. It is the API you will need to use to create and manipulate all the [main system elements](todo) required to operate a BitBroker instance.

Before you use this API, you should become familiar with the general, system-wide [API principles](todo) - which are used across all three BitBroker API sets. These principles include topics such as [standard logical server names and ports](todo), [RESTful designs](todo), [authorisation](todo), [error handling](todo), etc.
